# tidymind

tidymind is a simple app where a user can add tasks and save them (on a cloud). it stores the user entered data on a database and also fetches the data from there to display it. this project is built using react with the intent to practise building and working with custom react hooks. this project uses a custom hook called useHttp (entirely reusable & configurable from the outside) that manages some state and sends http requests to a backend.
